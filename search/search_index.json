The Packages file gets compressed with gzip . This will create a file called Packages.gz , and is a smaller version of the package list that your system will download. This file is one step before the packages in the directory tree. 4.) Release , Release.gpg , and InRelease are created. These files are contain metadata about the repository, as well as checksums for packages. Release.gpg and InRelease are signed by the repository's secret key. These files are one step before the packages in the directory tree. 5.) Finally, the updates are pushed to the repository. All the newly created files replace the old ones and updates can roll out to users. 6.) Users download and install packages from their systems. Upon running sudo apt update , the Debian system will locate the .list package from /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d . It checks for the Release, Release.gpg, InRelease, Packages, and public key, and if they can't be located, the command will exit with an error. If successful, packages can be updated with sudo apt upgrade , and new ones can be installed with sudo apt install <package name> .","title":"How does it work?"},{"location":"about/repository-keys/","text":"Secret and Public Keys The repository needs two keys in order to be secure.
